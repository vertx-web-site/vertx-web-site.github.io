Vert.x 5 comes with plenty of new exciting features, some of them have been developed in Vert.x 4 and made available
as tech previews.

Here is an overview of the most important features supported in Vert.x 5.

## Embracing the future based model

Vert.x 4 extended the 3.x callback asynchronous model to a future/callback hybrid model, to facilitate migration
from Vert.x 3.

Vert.x 5 only retains the future model and thus the callback model is removed.

Since the good old `AbstractVerticle` class lifecycle API is not best suited for the future based model, a new
`VerticleBase` base class is provided:

```java
public class MyVerticle extends VerticleBase {

  private HttpServer server;

  @Override
  public Future<?> start() {
    server = vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(req ->
      req.response()
        .putHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
        .end("Hello from Vert.x!"));

    // Now bind the server:
    return server.listen(8080);
  }
}
```

Both `VerticleBase` and `Verticle` extends a new `Deployable` interface, since that interface is functional you
can even write a one-liner verticle:

```java
Deployable verticle = context -> vertx
  .createHttpServer()
  .requestHandler(req -> req.response()
    .putHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
    .end("Hello from Vert.x!"))
  .listen(8080);
```

NOTE: `AbstractVerticle` is still fine and not deprecated, we simply recommend to use the base class that best works for
you

## Java Modules

Vert.x 5 supports the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) with explicit modules.

Most Vert.x components support modules (a few components though due to their dependencies cannot), you can read the
[Modular Vert.x guide](https://vertx.io/docs/guides/modular-vertx-guide/) to learn more and look at the 
[JPMS examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/jpms-examples).

## gRPC

Vert.x gRPC has many great additions in this major release, propelling Vert.x gRPC as a first class choice for implementing
gRPC services as well as interacting with them.

### gRPC protocols

The Vert.x gRPC Server enable support out of the box support for [gRPC Web](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-grpc/java/#_grpc_web_protocol)
protocol and [gRPC Transcoding](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-grpc/java/#grpc-transcoding) (i.e. without an intermediate proxy).

This [How-to](https://vertx.io/docs/howtos/grpc-web-howto/) explains how to generate a browser client with `protoc` and to communicate with the server.

Here is a simple [transcoding example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#transcoding).

### JSON wire format

gRPC implicitly assumes the usage of the Protobuf wire format, the Vert.x gRPC client supports the JSON wire format as well.

Here is a simple [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#json-wire-format).

Out of the box, any service is Protobuf and JSON capable of.

### Idiomatic code generation

A new idiomatic code generator is introduced in Vert.x 5

https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-grpc/java/#vertx-grpc-protoc-plugin

### gRPC deadlines

Vert.x gRPC handles timeout and deadlines in both [client](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-grpc/java/#_timeout_and_deadlines_2)
and [server](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0.5/vertx-grpc/java/#_timeout_and_deadlines)

Here is a simple [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#timeout-and-deadlines).

### Reflection service

Support for the [gRPC reflection service](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-grpc/java/#_grpc_reflection_apis) can be added to your Vert.x gRPC Server, which can be used by tools like
[gRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)

### Health service

The gRPC Health Service implements the standard gRPC health checking protocol, which allows clients to check the health status of your services.

Here is a simple [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#health-checking).

## OpenAPI & Vert.x OpenAPI Router

With Vert.X 5 the OpenAPI modules now also supports binary data.

Here you can find simple [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/openapi-examples) for Vert.x OpenAPI.

Here you can find simple [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/web-examples/src/main/java/io/vertx/example/web/openapi_router) for Vert.x OpenAPI Router.

## io_uring support

Vert. 4 has been supporting [io_uring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring) in incubation for a while with a separate jar.

Netty 4.2 has promoted io_uring out of incubation, as a consequence Vert.x Core supports it out of the box.

## Client side load balancing

Client side load balancing for HTTP based clients, with a wide variety of policies.

Here is a simple HTTP client [example](https://vertx.io/docs/howtos/k8s-client-side-lb-howto/) in Kubernetes
as well as a gRPC client [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#load-balancing).

## Service resolver

[Vert.x Service Resolver](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-service-resolver/java/) is a new addition to
the Vert.x stack aiming to provide dynamic address resolution for clients, it extends the vertx core client side load
balancing to a new set of service resolvers.

Enabled clients such as HTTP/Web/gRPC clients can use a service resolver to dynamically map a service address to a list of
network addresses.

You can find here a few [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/service-resolver-examples)

## HTTP proxy

The interception [side](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-http-proxy/java/#_proxy_interception) of our HTTP proxy
has been improved with out-of-the-box transformations and interceptor in WebSocket upgrades.

In addition, the caching part gets a proper caching Service Provider Interface (SPI) as well as extended support for
caching specifications.

You can find here a few [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/http-proxy-examples)

## Miscellaneous changes

### Unix domain sockets

Unix domain sockets have historically supported exclusively by native transports, they are now
[available](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-core/java/#_listening_to_unix_domain_sockets) for JDK 16 or greater.

### Connect options

TCP and HTTP clients have finer grained [Connect](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/apidocs/io/vertx/core/net/ConnectOptions.html)
capabilities, providing per connection SSL and proxy options. Previously such configuration was only possible client wide.

### Un-pooled HTTP connection

Default interactions with an HTTP servers involves providing a request object and let Vert.x HTTP client establish the
connection to the actual server and then pool it for subsequent uses.

Sometimes it is desirable to manage such connections instead of reusing pooled connections, for this use case the Vert.x
HTTP client provides [un-pooled](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-core/java/#_un_pooled_client_connections) connections.

You can find here an [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/blob/5.x/core-examples/README.adoc#un-managed-client-connection)

### Micrometer Metrics performance improvements

Our integration of Micrometer Metrics overhead has been reduced, you can learn more about that in this blog [post](https://vertx.io/blog/micrometer-metrics-performance/).

### TCP shutdown

HTTP server and client support graceful [shutdown](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-core/java/#_tcp_graceful_shut_down).

You can shut down a server or a client.

Calling `shutdown` initiates the shut-down phase whereby the server or client are given the opportunity to perform clean-up actions.

- A standalone HTTP server unbinds
- A shared HTTP server is removed from the set of accepting servers
- An HTTP client refuses to send any new requests

When all connections inflight requests are processed, the server or client is then closed.

You can find here an [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/core-examples#graceful-shutdown)

### Application Launcher

Application [launcher](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0/vertx-launcher-application/java/) is a new tool which addresses the
concern of launching a Vert.x application packaged as a far jar. It replaces the Vert.x 4 `io.vertx.core.Launcher`.

## Sunsets and removals

A few components are sunsetting in 5.0, that means they are still supported for the lifetime of the 5.x series,
but we don't encourage using them anymore since we provide replacements for them. Such components are scheduled
to go away in the next major release (Vert.x 6).

Here is the list of components we sunset in 5.x

| Component         | Replacement                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| gRPC Netty        | Vert.x gRPC client and server          |
| JDBC API          | SQL client API implementation for JDBC |
| Service Discovery | Vert.x Service Resolver                |
| OpenTracing       | OpenTelemetry                          |
| Vert.x Unit       | Vert.x JUnit 5                         |

Here is the list of components removed in 5.x, that were sunset in 4.x series.

- Vert.x Sync, replaced by Vert.x virtual threads
- Service Factories / Maven Service Factory / HTTP Service Factory
- RxJava 1, replaced by [SmallRye Mutiny](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/latest/) or [RxJava 3](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rx/java3/)

## Tooling

### Vert.x Maven Plugin

The [Vert.x Maven Plugin](https://reactiverse.io/vertx-maven-plugin), a [Reactiverse](https://reactiverse.io/) project, is a plugin for Apache Maven that helps to develop and/or to package Vert.x applications.

Its new major version, 2.0, supports both Vert.x 4 and Vert.x 5.
Therefore, if you already use this Maven plugin and Vert.x 4, you can upgrade the plugin before upgrading Vert.x.
This can make the migration process incremental.

### Contextual logging

[Reactiverse Contextual logging](https://reactiverse.io/reactiverse-contextual-logging/) version 2.0 supports Vert.x 5.

Like the Vert.x stack, it has been updated for better integration with the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).

Before upgrading from version 1, checkout the [migration guide](https://reactiverse.io/reactiverse-contextual-logging/#_migrating_from_version_1).
