With the upcoming release of Vert.x 3.3 securing your application with Keycloak is even easier than before.

## About Keycloak

Keycloak describes itself as an _Open Source Identity and Access Management For Modern Applications and Services_.

With Keycloak you can quickly add _Authentication_ and _Authorization_ to your vert.x application. The easy way is to
setup a realm on keycloak and once you're done, export the configuration to your vert.x app.

This how you would secure your app:

1. create a `OAuth2Auth` instance with `OAuth2Auth.createKeycloak(...)`
2. copy your config from the keycloak admin GUI
3. setup your callback according to what you entered on keycloak
4. secure your resource with `router.route("/protected/*").handler(oauth2)`
