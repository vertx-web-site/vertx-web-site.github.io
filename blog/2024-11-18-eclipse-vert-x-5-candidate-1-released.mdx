We are extremely pleased to announce the first candidate release of Eclipse Vert.x 5.

Vert.x 5 is the evolution of the Vert.x 4.x series that will bring key features to Vert.x.

This release aims to provide candidate builds of the up-coming Vert.x 5 for people that
want to try it and provide feedback.

Here are the highlights of this new major release.

## Embracing the future based model

Vert.x 4 extended the 3.x callback asynchronous model to a future/callback hybrid model, to facilitate migration
from Vert.x 3.

Vert.x 5 only retains the future model and thus the callback model is removed.

Since the good old `AbstractVerticle` class lifecycle API is not best suited for the future based model, a new
`VerticleBase` base class is provided:

```java
public class MyVerticle extends VerticleBase {

  private HttpServer server;

  @Override
  public Future<?> start() {
    server = vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(req ->
      req.response()
        .putHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
        .end("Hello from Vert.x!"));

    // Now bind the server:
    return server.listen(8080);
  }
}
```

Both `VerticleBase` and `Verticle` extends a new `Deployable` interface, since that interface is functional you
can even write a one-liner verticle:

```java
Deployable verticle = context -> vertx
  .createHttpServer()
  .requestHandler(req -> req.response()
    .putHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
    .end("Hello from Vert.x!"))
  .listen(8080);
```

NOTE: `AbstractVerticle` is still fine and not deprecated, we simply recommend to use the base class that best works for 
you

## Java Modules

Vert.x 5 supports the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) with explicit modules (Vert.x 4 supports only automatic modules).

Most Vert.x components support modules (a few components though due to their dependencies cannot), the Modular Vert.x guide will give more information
about it, in the meantime you can look at out [JPMS examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/jpms-examples).

## gRPC improvements

Vert.x gRPC has a few great additions in this major release, propelling Vert.x gRPC as a first class choice for implementing
gRPC services.

### gRPC Web

The Vert.x gRPC Server supports the [gRPC Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md#protocol-differences-vs-grpc-over-http2)
protocol by default (i.e. without an intermediate proxy).

On the Vert.x side, enabling the gRPC Web protocol support is a mere switch in options.
In the near feature, we will provide a [tutorial](https://how-to.vertx.io/) explaining how to generate a browser client with `protoc` and to communicate with the server.

### gRPC deadlines

Vert.x gRPC handles timeout and deadlines in both [client](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/vertx-grpc/java/#_timeout_and_deadlines_2)
and [server](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/vertx-grpc/java/#_timeout_and_deadlines)

Here is a simple [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#timeout-and-deadlines).

### JSON wire format

gRPC implicitly assumes the usage of the Protobuf wire format, the Vert.x gRPC client supports the JSON wire format as well.

Here is a simple [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#json-wire-format).

## OpenAPI & Vert.x OpenAPI Router

With Vert.X 5 the OpenAPI modules now also supports binary data.

Here you can find simple [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/openapi-examples) for Vert.x OpenAPI.

Here you can find simple [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/web-examples/src/main/java/io/vertx/example/web/openapi_router) for Vert.x OpenAPI Router.

## io_uring support

Vert. 4 has been supporting [io_uring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring) in incubation for a while with a separate jar.

Netty 4.2 has promoted io_uring out of incubation, as consequence Vert.x Core supports it out of the box.

## Client side load balancing

Client side load balancing for HTTP based clients, with a wide variety of policies.

Here is a simple HTTP client [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/blob/5.x/core-examples/README.adoc#load-balancing)
as well as a gRPC HTTP client [example](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/grpc-examples#load-balancing).l

## Service resolver

[Vert.x Service Resolver](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/vertx-service-resolver/java/) is a new addition to
the Vert.x stack aiming to provide dynamic address resolution for clients, it extends the vertx core client side load 
balancing to a new set of service resolvers.

Enabled clients such as HTTP/Web/gRPC clients can use a service resolver to dynamically map a service address to a list of
network addresses.

You can find here a few [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/5.x/service-resolver-examples).

## HTTP proxy

The interception [side](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/vertx-http-proxy/java/#_proxy_interception) of our HTTP proxy
has been improved with out-of-the-box transformations and interceptor in WebSocket upgrades.

In addition, the caching part gets a proper caching Service Provider Interface (SPI) as well as extended support for 
caching specifications.

## Miscellaneous changes

### Unix domain sockets

Unix domain sockets have historically supported exclusively by native transports, they are now
[available](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/vertx-core/java/#_listening_to_unix_domain_sockets) for JDK 16 or greater.

### Connect options

TCP and HTTP clients have finer grained [Connect](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/io/vertx/core/net/ConnectOptions.html)
capabilities, providing per connection SSL and proxy options. Previously such configuration was only possible client wide.

### Un-pooled HTTP connection

Default interactions with an HTTP servers involves providing a request object and let Vert.x HTTP client establish the 
connection to the actual server and then pool it for subsequent uses.

Sometimes it is desirable to manage such connections instead of reusing pooled connections, for this use case you can use now the Vert.x
HTTP client [connect](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/io/vertx/core/http/HttpClientAgent.html#connect(io.vertx.core.http.HttpConnectOptions))
capabilities.

### Micrometer Metrics performance improvements

Our integration of Micrometer Metrics overhead has been reduced, you can learn more about that in this blog [post](https://vertx.io/blog/micrometer-metrics-performance/).

### TCP shutdown

HTTP server and client support graceful shutdown.

You can shut down a server or a client.

Calling `shutdown` initiates the shut-down phase whereby the server or client are given the opportunity to perform clean-up actions.

- A standalone HTTP server unbinds
- A shared HTTP server is removed from the set of accepting servers
- An HTTP client refuses to send any new requests

When all connections inflight requests are processed, the server or client is then closed.

### Application Launcher

Application [launcher](https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/vertx-launcher-application/java/) is a new tool which addresses the
concern of launching a Vert.x application packaged as a far jar. It replaces the Vert.x 4 `io.vertx.core.Launcher`.

## Sunsets and removals

A few components are sunsetting in 5.0, that means they are still supported for the lifetime of the 5.x series,
but we don't encourage using them anymore since we provide replacements for them. Such components are scheduled
to go away in the next major release (Vert.x 6).

Here is the list of components we sunset in 5.x

| Component         | Replacement                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| gRPC Netty        | Vert.x gRPC client and server          |
| JDBC API          | SQL client API implementation for JDBC |
| Service Discovery | Vert.x Service Resolver                |
| RxJava 1          | Mutiny or RxJava 3                     |
| OpenTracing       | OpenTelemetry                          |
| Vert.x Unit       | Vert.x JUnit 5                         |

Here is the list of components removed in 5.x, that were sunset in 4.x series.

- Vert.x Sync, replaced by Vert.x virtual threads 
- Service Factories / Maven Service Factory / HTTP Service Factory 

## Finally

Most importantly the documentation has been deployed on this preview web-site https://vertx.io/docs/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
