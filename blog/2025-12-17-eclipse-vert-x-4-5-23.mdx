We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.5.23 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.5.22, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition, [CVE-2025-67735](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67735) has been disclosed and fixed in this release.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.5.23).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) and our
[HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap).

Vert.x follows a 2 years policy after a major release, as consequence Vert.x remains supported until April 2027 and get
bug fixes, you should consider [upgrading](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-4-to-vert-x-5/) your application to Vert.x 5.

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
