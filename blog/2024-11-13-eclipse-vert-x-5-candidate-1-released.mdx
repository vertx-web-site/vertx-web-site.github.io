We are extremely pleased to announce the first candidate release of Eclipse Vert.x 5.

Vert.x 5 is the evolution of the Vert.x 4.x series that will bring key features to Vert.x.

This release aims to provide candidate builds of the up-coming Vert.x 5 for people that
want to try it and provide feedback.

Talk about backports to 4.x

Here are the highlights of this release.

## Embracing the future based model

Vert.x 4 extended the 3.x callback asynchronous model to a future/callback hybrid model, to facilitate migration
from Vert.x 3.

Vert.x 5 only retains the future model and thus the callback model is removed.

Since the good old `AbstractVerticle` class lifecycle API is not best suited for the future based model, a new
`VerticleBase` base class is provided:

```java
public class MyVerticle extends VerticleBase {

  private HttpServer server;

  @Override
  public Future<?> start() {
    server = vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(req ->
      req.response()
        .putHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
        .end("Hello from Vert.x!"));

    // Now bind the server:
    return server.listen(8080);
  }
}
```

Both `VerticleBase` and `Verticle` extends a new `Deployable` interface, since that interface is functional you
can even write a one-liner verticle:

```java
Deployable verticle = context -> vertx
  .createHttpServer()
  .requestHandler(req -> req.response()
    .putHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
    .end("Hello from Vert.x!"))
  .listen(8080);
```

NOTE: `AbstractVerticle` is still fine and not deprecated, we simply recommend to use the base class that best works for 
you
