### Eclipse Vert.x and reactive in just a few words

Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building **reactive** applications on the JVM.

Reactive applications are both **scalable** as workloads grow, and **resilient** when failures arise.

A reactive application is **responsive** as it keeps latency under control by making efficient usage of system resources, and by protecting itself from errors.

![Microservices](/images/introduction/microservices.svg)

Vert.x is backed by a large ecosystem of reactive modules with just anything you need when writing modern services: a comprehensive web stack, reactive database drivers, messaging, event streams, clustering, metrics, distributed tracing and more.

Vert.x is a toolkit and not a framework that ships with black magic: **what you write is actually what you get to execute**, as simple as that.

So what makes Vert.x a great option for writing your next **cloud-native** or **[twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/)** app?

### In the beginning there were threads...

The classic approach to concurrency is to use **threads**.

Multiple threads can live within a single **process**, perform **concurrent** work, and **share** the same memory space.

![Threads](/images/introduction/threads.svg)

Most application and service development frameworks are based on multi-threading.

On the surface the model of having **1 thread per connection** is reassuring because developers can rely on traditional **imperative style** code.

This is fine, especially if you forget about those silly mistakes you can make with multi-threading and memory access...

### Multi-threading is "simple" but limited

What happens as the workload grows beyond moderate workloads?
[(see the C10k problem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem)

The answer is simple: you start making your operating system kernel **suffer** because there is too much **context switching** work with in-flight requests.

![Blocking I/O](/images/introduction/blocking-io.svg)

Some of your threads will be **blocked** because they are waiting on I/O operations to complete, some will be **ready** to handle I/O results, and some will be in the middle of doing CPU-intensive tasks.

Modern kernels have very good schedulers, but you cannot expect them to deal with 50 000 threads as easily as they would do with 5000.

Also threads aren't cheap: creating a thread takes a few milliseconds, and a new thread eats about 1MB of memory.

### Asynchronous programming: scalability and resource efficiency

Processing more concurrent connections with less threads is possible when you use **asynchronous I/O**.

Instead of blocking a thread when an I/O operation occurs, we move on to another task which is ready to progress, and resume the initial task later when it is ready.

Vert.x multiplexes concurrent workloads using **event-loops**.

![Event loop](/images/introduction/event-loop.svg)

Code that runs on event-loops shall not perform blocking I/O or lengthy processing but don't worry if you have such code: Vert.x has worker threads and APIs to process events back on an event-loop.

### Pick the best asynchronous programming model for your problem domain

We know that asynchronous programming requires more efforts.
At the core of Vert.x we support **callbacks** and **promises / futures**, the later being a simple and elegant model for chaining asynchronous operations.

Advanced reactive programming is possible with [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), and if you prefer something closer to traditional imperative programming then we are happy to provide you with first-class support of [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html).

![Async](/images/introduction/async.svg)

Vert.x supports many asynchronous programming models: choose what works best for each problem you need to solve!

### Don't let failures ruin responsiveness

Failures happen all the time.
A database will go down, the network will go down, or some service you depend on will become unresponsive.

![Failures](/images/introduction/failures.svg)

Vert.x offers tools to keep latency under control, including a simple and efficient **circuit breaker**.

### A rich ecosystem

Databases, messaging, event streaming, web, IoT, authentication, container environments, metrics, ... you name it.

![Ecosystem](/images/introduction/ecosystem.svg)

We have a rich ecosystem of modules in the Vert.x stack for covering most of your needs.

There is also a larger ecosystem around Vert.x: see [the Reactiverse](https://reactiverse.io/) and [Awesome Vert.x](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-awesome).
