## Get started with Vert.x

In this guide you'll learn how to get started with a new Vert.x Web project.

Before starting, you need:

* A JDK 1.8 or higher
* A text editor or IDE
* Maven 3 or higher
* curl or HTTPie or a browser to perform HTTP requests

### Step 1: Bootstrap

To create a new project, go to [start.vertx.io](start.vertx.io).

Choose the version of Vert.x you want to use, choose Java as the language, Maven as the build tool, and
type the group id and artifact id you want. Then, add **Vert.x Web** as a dependency by typing it in the
Dependencies text box. When you're done, hit the **Generate project** button.
Save the zip on your computer and unzip it in a folder of your choice.

The generated project contains:

* The Maven build descriptor `pom.xml` configured to build and run your application
* A sample Verticle and a sample test using JUnit 5
* An editor configuration to enforce code style
* A Git configuration to ignore files

### Step 2: Code

Open the project in the editor of your choice and navigate to `src/main/java/com/example/starter/MainVerticle.java`.
This source file contains a sample `Verticle` (the Vert.x deployment unit) that starts an HTTP server.
You're going to modify it to greet whoever performs requests to your server.
Change the code with the following:

```java
public class MainVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {

  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    // Create a Router
    Router router = Router.router(vertx);

    // Mount the handler for all incoming requests at every path and HTTP method
    router.route().handler(context -> {
      // Get the address of the request
      String address = context.request().connection().remoteAddress().toString();
      // Get the query parameter "name"
      MultiMap queryParams = context.queryParams();
      String name = queryParams.contains("name") ? queryParams.get("name") : "unknown";
      // Write a json response
      context.json(
        new JsonObject()
          .put("name", name)
          .put("address", address)
          .put("message", "Hello " + name + " connected from " + address)
      );
    });

    // Create the HTTP server
    vertx.createHttpServer()
      // Handle every request using the router
      .requestHandler(router)
      // Start listening
      .listen(8888)
      // Print the port
      .onSuccess(server ->
        System.out.println(
          "HTTP server started on port " + server.actualPort()
        )
      );
  }
}
```

This code creates a Vert.x Web Router (the object used to route HTTP requests to specific request handlers)
and starts an HTTP Server on port `8888`. On each request it returns a json containing the address of the request, the query parameter `name` and a greeting message.

### Step 3: Run

To run the code:
* Open a terminal
* Navigate to your project folder
* Type `mvn package` to build the application
```shell
% mvn package
```
* Type `mvn exec:java` to run it:
```
% mvn exec:java
HTTP server started on port 8888
apr 03, 2020 11:49:21 AM io.vertx.core.impl.launcher.commands.VertxIsolatedDeployer
INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```

Now that the server is up and running, try to send a request using `http` (or another tool of your choice):
```shell
% http http://localhost:8888
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 115
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "address": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:32806",
    "message": "Hello unknown connected from 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:32806",
    "name": "unknown"
}

% http http://localhost:8888\?name\="Francesco"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 119
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "address": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:32822",
    "message": "Hello Francesco connected from 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:32822",
    "name": "Francesco"
}
```

### Step 4: Go further
Now that you have had a taste of how easy and fun it is to get started with Vert.x, here are a few pointers to help guide you further into the rabbit hole:
* Deep dive through the documentation to check out all Vert.x modules: [Documentation](https://vertx-web-site.github.io/docs/)
* Check out the Vert.x ecosystem: [Vert.x Ecosystem](example.com)
* Check out the Vert.x how-to to get pragmatic guides for specific topics: [Vert.x How-to home](https://how-to.vertx.io/)
